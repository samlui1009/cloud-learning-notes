# Cloud Computing Knowledge Repository ☁️💻
<p>This is a Markdown-based repository, utilized to document my own personal learnings on topics related to cloud computing, diving deeply into cloud and backend architecture, and containerization tools (Docker, Kubernetes).</p>

## Inspiration for Project
<p>As an intern who is making their first foray into cloud computing, the incredible and sheer amount of learning material can be a lot and - at times - <i>overwhelming</i>. My goal for this Markdown-based repository is to document my own personal learnings on related topics, which will dive into cloud/backend architecture and containerization technologies (Docker, Kubernetes). This knowledge repo will be continually added as I also learn more - both through hands-on exposure and through self-learning.</p>

## Project Structure 
Within this repository, topics are segregated into different directories. 

<br>

<ul>
    <li><b>Cloud Computing</b>:
        <p>Includes subjects on AWS, and networking</p>
    </li>
    
    <li><b>Containerization</b>:
        <p>Includes subjects on Docker, Kubernetes (K8s)</p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Spring & Spring Boot</b>:
        <p>As my role aims to assist in performing the migration from Spring to Spring Boot for internal Java services, this section will cover subjects on Spring, the differences between Spring and Spring Boot, and how to set up XML files for dependencies.</p>
